# Internships
This repo is mainly created for the internship students to check in code 

1. Dataset and Preprocessing

    The dataset used is a cleaned COVID-19 file (covid-19.csv) containing demographic and health indicators such as population density, temperature, humidity, and sex ratio.

    The Date column is converted into a datetime format using Pandas for proper time series visualization.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Streamlit Interface and Widgets

    The dashboard uses various Streamlit widgets to allow user interaction:

        selectbox for choosing a country

        checkboxes to toggle different visual elements on and off

    The interface is neatly divided into a main area (for content) and a sidebar (for filters and toggles), making it intuitive for users.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Visualizations

The dashboard includes at least four different types of visualizations:

    Line Chart: Displays the trend of average temperature over time.

    Bar Chart: Shows the distribution of population density.

    Pie Chart: Approximates gender ratio using the sexratio column.

    Map (optional): Plots geographical locations (latitude and longitude) of COVID-19 cases using Streamlit's st.map().

These visualizations help users understand the data in both statistical and geographical contexts.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Summary Statistics

    The app dynamically computes and displays mean, median, and count for:

        Population density (density)

        Average temperature (avgtemp)

        Average humidity (avghumidity)

    This offers quick insights into the central tendencies and spread of the data.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Layout and User Experience

    The layout includes clear titles, section headers, emojis, and markdown formatting to make the dashboard visually appealing and well-organized.

    Users can toggle views (charts/stats/maps) as needed, which enhances interactivity and avoids clutter.
